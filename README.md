# Planner-save-the-day

The Planner application is here to save the day! Keep certain events and reminders for certain times of your work day! By utilizing bootstrap, moment.js, jquery, localstorage, css and HTML; I have made a planner that won't be erased when the page is refreshed. This will allow you to come back and look at the things on your day planner. In addition to saving what you put in, you can go back in and change it! Extremely useful because your day can change by the HOUR. You know what else changes by the hour? The daily planner shows the times that have passed and will grey them out, it will show the current hour block and make it red so it is easily identifiable and Future hours are green. It was a great experience and interesting to see how all these different elements came together and created an amazing application.
